            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 10, 2014 by <a href="#">Kevin</a></p>
              <p>I've read and written a lot of feedback in the past 9 weeks. Personally, I find feedback most useful when there's a clear cause and effect stated: "You did this and this happened as a result." I don't really care for the sugarcoated comments because they don't usually address a specific action. Because the feedback we got was a one-way exchange, I didn't really find it that useful. I like asking questions to better understand what others think, so not being able to respond to the feedback made it really hit-or-miss depending on how specific the feedback was. Feedback doesn't always have to be negative, but as long as it's actionable, the person receiving it can take something away from it. That isn't to say that everyone's feedback is always right. They interpret your actions based on their perception and life experiences, so it's up to you to determine the reliability of your feedback.</p>

              <p>My thinking style is Abstract Sequential, which means I love the world of theory and abstract thought. Here's a <a href="http://www.cgribben.com/psych/as.html">link</a> I found that describes Abstract Sequential thinkers, and I have to say that a lot of it does describe me. In terms of how it would benefit me at DBC, it mentions that my environmental preference would be somewhere mentally stimulating, and that's the reason I applied to DBC to begin with. I find that I learn better in these types of environments. I'm also a logical and rational thinker, so I think that would be beneficial for some more complex coding challenges. It also says that my focus of attention is on knowledge, facts, and documentation, which is how I learn best when I don't understand something.</p>

              <p>My biggest struggle in Phase 0 has been my reluctance to change my methodology in doing some things, and it may be related to the way I think. That link says that when it comes to change, I am notoriously indecisive, cross-checking everything, caught up in deliberation; you are a fence straddler. I definitely should be open and broaden my horizons since there are so many ways of doing the same thing when it comes to code.</p>
