            <p><a href="http://www.teamliquid.net">Teamliquid</a> is a site for competitive games forum that start back in 2002. I first started visiting it in 2008 when I was introduced to the competitive StarCraft scene by a friend. The design was very different back then, but the basic design of it has remained the same. I'll talk about why I like it now in 2014, after it went through multiple evolutions.</p>

            <p>The header has a nice banner with a lot of navigation tools to go through the site's various features. It also features settings for your forum account and filter that lets you filter certain games from the site, if you only follow only one or some of the games as opposed to all of them. There are also links to partner sites and clock for EDT, CET and KST, which is important for following all the international events that the site keeps track of.</p>

            <p>The body in the middle changes depending on what the user wants to see. The initial page is a news/spotlight section that is updated constantly. There's also a different layout for viewing forum posts, live video streams, and other various content.</p>

            <p>The sidebar on the left shows the hierarchy of all the main forums and sub-forums that the user can customize based on their preferences. It provides an easy to understand outline for how the forum is organized, and the most recent posts in each sub-forum is shown first. The sidebar on the right is full of information for people to spend a lot of time on. There's a list of events with a calendar and countdown timer for them, a list of live streams that the user can watch right on the site, and databases of information and records of specific games.</p>

            <p>There's a plethora of pages that leads to other parts of the site, and that's one of the reasons I've been on this site for so long. It keeps you engaged and it provides a sort of hub for all this information about competitive games that would otherwise be scattered across the internet.</p>

            <br>

            <p>My second favorite website is <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>. Its design has remained very similar to what it was when they started the site, but that's a good thing. The design is very simple, and the main draw is how user-posted content is evaluated by other users using Reddit's system of upvotes and downvotes.</p>

            <p>Users post content to the site, whether it be a link to a picture of kittens, a news article, or a video, and other users can give it an upvote or a downvote. The culmination of these votes decide how far up the content goes on the site, and the posts that have the highest score go onto the front page of the site.</p>

            <p>You can customize the content you see on your front page by subscribing to different subreddits, which are smaller communities that focus on a specific subject, like /r/programming or /r/nyc.</p>

            <br>

            <p>And lastly, another site I enjoy very much is <a href="http://www.twitch.tv"> Twitch.tv</a>. It's a site that offers a service that lets people stream their games and have other people watch them live.</p>

            <p>The front page is a directory for the most popular streams currently running, and lets you sort the channels by game and current viewer count. When you're on a channel the video is displayed in the middle frame with the streamer's channel information. The right side has a live chat that allows viewers to chat with each other, as well as the streamer. There's also a tab that lets you see related videos that were previously recorded. The left sidebar has links to let you browse the directory of channels and change your user settings.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I think overall, what I like most about these sites is the content, which is controlled by the community that visits the site, and the simple design that keeps you in the site.</p>
