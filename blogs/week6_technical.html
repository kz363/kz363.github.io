              <p>To understand the difference between object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP), we must first understand what each of them are. OOP, as the name might suggest, is a method of programming that involves objects. In Ruby, everything is an object. An object is piece of code that lets you create similar pieces of code without repeating the same code over an over. These are usually done with a class, which is like a blueprint of an object, where you can define variables and methods for every instance of the class to use.</p>
              <p>For example, you can have an animal class that has very general methods like eating and sleeping. The variables could be weight and color. These are things that all animals have. Rather than having to write this code for every animal, you can just create new animals from your animal class and use the methods and variables that you've already coded once. You can even inherit these methods and variables and make another class, let's say dog, and add even more like barking, sitting, breed, and more. OOP just makes code easier to organize and expand on in the future.</p>
              <p>Although I don't have much experience with FP, this is what I can gather from reading up on it. FP is a way of programming that views every piece of code as an evaluation that does only one thing, and you selectively execute these functions to solve the problem at hand. For example, you can have a function that computes the area of a square, and one that computes the area of a triangle. If you call the square function 3 times, you can compute the area of a cube. If you combine the square and triangle functions, you can find the area of a parallelogram. By using these simple functions in creative ways, you can complete complex tasks with them</p>
              <p>This leads to the question of when you should be using OOP or FP. OOP makes it easier to develop large complex systems because it gives developers the ability to change every object independently. In FP, what ends up happening as the system grows, is that it just becomes a huge pile of functions. Every one of these functions are interconnected and dependent on each other, which means changing one function may break several others, and it becomes impossible to manage. In the end, you can always accomplish the same result with either method, but which one you use should largely depend on the task at hand.</p>
