              <p>I wish we watched Shereef's Fireside Chat when we first got into DBC because it would've put my mind at ease about the whole experience that I was getting into. I understand that the whole curriculum is constantly changing for the better, so my participation in it is almost like a patient in a clinical study on a new drug. I don't mind being experimented on as long as I feel like I got the most out of the experience.</p>
              <p>Shereef mentioned the Kitchen vs Table analogy, and I've come to understand that after this prep phase. While I do understand his points about everyone at DBC working together in the kitchen, at the same time, I am still a customer who has ordered something from a restaurant and I expect the food to be good. I chose DBC after applying for 6 other bootcamps because I have faith that the food will be worth my time and money.</p>
              <p>Shereef also talked about how DBC also stresses human relations alongside teaching code, and I agree with what he says. You could be the smartest programmer in the world, but it's still hard to work with someone who can't communicate their thoughts and ideas to others properly. More often than that, programmers work in teams and good communication in the workplace is essential to be efficient, which brings me to the next point.</p>
              <p>The biggest thing I took away from the video was when Shereef answered questions about managing time. It's one of the biggest problems in the software engineering world. How far down the road do you go before you realize you should stop? I run into this problem a lot, and I ran into it this week when I was working on the Grocery List challenge in Javascript. I'm really stubborn about solving something I don't know/understand, and on that challenge I spent hours debugging silly things that I could've done more efficiently if I just took a break and came back to it. I'll take Shereef's advice in the future about disciplining yourself with 20 minutes to do something.</p>
