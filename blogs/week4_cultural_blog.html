            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 5, 2014 by <a href="#">Kevin</a></p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</b></li>
              <p>I created a Starcraft team in college and we used to communicate with each other with an e-mail discussion thread. There was a player, R, on the team who used to be active, but stopped playing and switched to playing League of Legends. One of the other players asked a question about the game and R responded with an answer that I knew was wrong, so I sent a link in the e-mail thread proving him wrong. He went livid and we had an argument through public e-mails.</p>
              <li><b>What was the source of the conflict?</b></li>
              <p>I said his answer was misinformed because he doesn't play the game anymore. I've joked with him in the past about him switching his loyalty to a different game but it seemed like it ticked him off a lot more this time. His first response was a lot of cussing at me, so I knew he was in a bad mood already. He started pointing out other e-mails I sent in the past that sounded derogatory, which the rest of the team told him that he misinterpreted because my e-mails consist of snarky humor.</p>
              <li><b>How did you handle that conflict?</b></li>
              <p>He kept attacking me personally, to which I felt obliged to defend myself. This went out of hand and I tried to keep our argument on track. Because he never addressed the actual problem, which was his answer being wrong, I kept asking him if he actually clicked the link I sent but he ignored me.</p>
              <li><b>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</b></li>
              <p>Definitely worse. I knew I was right, the rest of the team knew I was right, but he wasn't in the right state of mind and didn't care that I was right. Nothing I said could've deescalated the situation, but I couldn't keep my mouth shut.</p>
              <li><b>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</b></li>
              <p>I wouldn't have engaged in the argument with someone who was clearly having a bad day. He normally isn't that irritable.</p>
              <li><b>What did you learn from this experience?</b></li>
              <p>When people are hotheaded beyond reason, it's best to not push their buttons and avoid conflict.</p>
