            <p>One of the main reasons I joined DBC was to work with a community of people who all wanted to learn programming together. It helps to keep me motivated and helps me learn more quickly as well. Because of this, I really enjoyed the pairing sessions I had. Not only do I get to have someone else to bounce ideas off of to complete a challenge, but I also get to listen to their perspective about how to go about things. I always find it interesting how despite the end result being the same, two people can code things so differently. I found it rewarding to teach someone something they're unfamiliar with, and the same goes for when I'm the one being taught something new. I didn't find any moment frustrating or difficult because the people I worked with were all amazing and were easy to work with.</p>
            <p>I haven't received any feedback from Socrates yet, so I can't comment on any of it. I'll update this if I do, however. As for writing feedback, I found it nice to be able to talk about how the session went after it was over. The most difficult part for me was specifying exactly what went well, because for me it felt like a lot of moments just happened naturally and we just went with the flow. I also don't have a good idea of what Actionable feedback is supposed to be like, but I wish to find some good examples.</p>
