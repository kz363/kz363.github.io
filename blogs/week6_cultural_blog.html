            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 20, 2014 by <a href="#">Kevin</a></p>
              <p>Stereotype threat is a subject that I find hard to write about, mostly because I haven't had to deal with it in my life. I'm lucky enough to have gone to school and worked in places where my race or gender hasn't put pressure on me nor hindered my performance in any way. However, reading up on the subject does present it as a problem to me when it comes to working in diverse teams.</p>
              <p>Even though it's easy to say that everyone is born equal, it isn't the case in many situations because of some stereotypes. I believe the most important step for someone to overcome stereotypes is to understand that they exist and can hinder their performance. Obviously this is only my speculation, but here's a quote on mitigating stereotype threat from Wikipedia - "In one study, teaching college women about stereotype threat and its effects on performance was sufficient to eliminate the predicted gender gap on a difficult math test. Making people aware of the fact that they will not necessarily perform worse simply due to the existence of a stereotype, can boost their performance."</p>
              <p>Stereotypes are hard to avoid, but the best way for an individual to get past them is to understand that their social identity is not defined by their race or gender. They are individuals that are complex and multi-faceted, and they should not feel pressured to conform to the stereotypes that society places on them.</p>
