Website Plan:

A "blog" site similar to WordPress that I can customize to better fit my needs. How I envision it so far is with a standard Header, Body, and Footer. The Header will contain a banner and some simple buttons to navigate around the site. The Body will contain a sidebar on the left that links to recent posts, a content area in the middle to view posts and other stuff. I'm not sure what to put in the Footer yet.

I want each post to look different depending on whether I'm posting text, links, pictures, or files. How each will be displayed is uncertain for now.
